# Week10-Mingren

For my final project, I wanted to create an app for people to keep track of subscriptions on their phones. The app will help users manage their monthly spending by providing a clear overview of all subscriptions and upcoming bills. The app will send a notification whenever a bill is due. Users can customize the notification setting. With the notification setting on, people can look at all their recurring charges at a glance and cancel any unneeded subscriptions (or free trials) in time before getting charged again.

## Feedback
* Add feature for reminding users to pay the bill
* Allow more customization
