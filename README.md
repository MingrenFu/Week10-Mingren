# Week10-Mingren

For my final project, I wanted to create an app for people to keep track of subscriptions on their phones. The app will help users manage their monthly spending by providing a clear overview of all subscriptions and upcoming bills. The app will send a notification whenever a bill is due. Users can customize the notification setting. With the notification setting on, people can look at all their recurring charges at a glance and cancel any unneeded subscriptions (or free trials) in time before getting charged again.


Step 1: Create a basic list view
Step 2: Create a add button for people to modify the list
Step 3: Create a screen for users to specify the detail (name, price, date) of their subscription 
Step 4: Add the setting

## Feedback
* Add feature for reminding users to pay the bill
* Allow more customization
